# Verb Conjugator.py

While I am learning Python and French, I wanted to practise my knowledge and improve my learning and help others as well. 

For online Verb Conjugators, you can find some lovely sites like *https://francais.lingolia.com/en/grammar/conjugator*, but to practise Python, and my French, both at Beginner levels BTW, I created this Python project. _I will add more verbs and useful feautures in the future as my knowledge expands in Python and French._
