While I am learning Python and French, I wanted to practise my knowledge and improve my learning and help others as well. 📚🇫🇷🐍

For online Verb Conjugators, you can find some lovely sites like [Lingolia's French Verb Conjugator](https://francais.lingolia.com/en/grammar/conjugator) 🌐, but to practise Python, and my French, both at Beginner levels BTW, I created this Python project. 🐍🇫🇷


I will prepare and add more verbs and useful features in the future as my knowledge expands in Python and French. 💡
